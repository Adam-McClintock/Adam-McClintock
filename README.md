### Hello ðŸ‘‹

 âš¡ I'm a Senior Test Automation Engineer who mainly utilises Selenium, C# & Specflow to develop my frameworks however I do enjoy learning new tech.

- ðŸ”­ Most of my experience has involved working with public sector clients utilising GDS Framework in both the UK & NI Gov including:

      âš« Department for Education - UK
      âš« Department for Communities - NI
      âš« Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) - UK
      âš« NI Direct - Driver & Vehicle Agency (DVA)
      
 - ðŸŒ± I enjoy developing frameworks in my spare time that are generic enough to be plugged into different projects in order to hit the ground running, with the view to then of course customise these frameworks depending on the project that I am on. 
I have also been on projects where I've inherited frameworks and made them better, it just very much depends on the project - but I do find it a bit more interesting when I create a fresh framework from the ground up. 

- ðŸ¤” I'm always looking to learn and develop my skills so you are very much welcome to contribute to any of my public frameworks in order to make positive improvements on them.
